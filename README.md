# CEN212 Microprocessors Project
## 📍Time Display with 7 Segment Indicator
### Project Description and Purpose
<p>
This project aims to create a digital clock using a 7 segment display. When the microprocessor is energised, 00:00:00 will be displayed as the start time. Then, using delay functions, the hour, minute and second values will be updated in real time. The user will be able to set the time using the hour select, minute select, increment and decrement keys. The seconds value will be reset automatically when the time is set.

In addition, an alarm function will be integrated into the project. This alarm function will enable the alarm to sound at the time specified by the user and the user will be able to enable or disable the alarm at any time.

This project aims to provide a basic digital watch structure as well as an enhanced watch experience with a user-friendly interface and additional functions. It also aims to simulate the real life functions of digital clocks in a virtual environment by using microprocessor and 7 segment display.

**Note:** *The programme is written in assembly code and the code is planned to run only on 8086.*

### Equipment List and Requirements
- Microprocessor (8086)
- 7 Segment Display
- Emulator (emu8086)
- Simulation Environment (Proteus)

**Note:** *The relevant equipment to be used in the project will be provided in a virtual environment via Proteus (Microprocessor - 7 Segment Display).*
